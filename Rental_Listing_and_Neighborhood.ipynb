        "\n",
        "In the dynamic field of Data/ML, engaging with Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) is a common practice, enabling the extraction of data or interaction with software. Nonetheless, not all applications/services offer API so it is important to understand how to extract data even in cases where an API is not available. Similarly, adapting to various data management techniques is essential across different companies or organizations. This project centers around gathering data from rental listings within Alberta, Canada, specifically focusing on platforms such as Kijiji and RentFaster. Additionally, you will be leveraging the Yelp API, you'll identify highly rated restaurants and analyze their proximity to these rental listings you scraped from RentFaster and Kijiji.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data acquisition phase is facilitated through a pre-developed web scraper, designed to streamline the process of extracting rental listings. This initiative is in collaboration with the Community Data Program, aiming to make rental listing data within Canada more accessible to communities with limited access. Initially focusing on Alberta, this project sets the groundwork for future expansion across other regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your task involves determining the pertinent data to extract, followed by managing this data within a distributed system, namely Apache Spark. Subsequently, you will perform data analysis and processing utilizing Spark SQL. This final project encourages collaboration in groups of up to 3 members (you are allowed to use the same members as your midterm), where active participation from all members is expected. It's crucial to note that your presentation will constitute 30% of your overall score, highlighting the importance of both teamwork and individual effort in the successful completion of this project.\n",

        "\n",
        "Playwright is a tool developed by Microsoft that allows developers to automate interactions with web browsers. In simpler terms, it can control browsers programmatically to perform tasks like navigating through web pages, clicking buttons, filling out forms, and extracting information from websites, all through a script or program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s why Playwright is particularly useful for web scraping rental listings in RentFaster and Kijiji:\n",
        "1. **Supports Multiple Browsers**: Playwright can control different browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) using a single API. This makes it easier to scrape websites as they appear in various browsers without needing to adjust your code significantly for each one.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Headless Browsing**: It can run browsers in 'headless' mode, meaning it can navigate and interact with websites without actually opening a browser window. This speeds up the scraping process and allows for running scrapers on servers or in environments where a graphical interface is not available.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Automates Complex Interactions**: Some websites require complex interactions to access their data, like logging in, navigating through menus, or interacting with JavaScript. Playwright can automate these interactions, making it possible to scrape data from sites that would be difficult or impossible to scrape with simpler tools.\n",

        "### Web Scraping Libraries - Explained\n",
        "\n",
        "When scraping rental listings from websites like Kijiji and RentFaster, several Python libraries will be of use in the process. Here's how each of them contributes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`asyncio`**: This is a library to write concurrent code using the async/await syntax. It is useful for handling asynchronous operations, making it possible to scrape websites more efficiently. When used with `playwright`, it allows for asynchronous navigation and interaction with web pages, speeding up the web scraping process by performing multiple tasks concurrently.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`json`**: JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight data interchange format. This library can be used to parse JSON data that will be returned from HTML requests on rental websites and to store scraped data in a JSON format, making it easier to work with complex data structures using Spark.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`requests`**: A powerful HTTP library for making requests to web servers. It is used to request the HTML content of web pages from Kijiji and RentFaster. `requests` is straightforward and can handle various types of HTTP requests, essential for accessing the data on rental listings.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`time`**: This module provides various time-related functions. We will use it to handle rate limiting by adding delays between requests, ensuring that your scraping activities do not lead to your IP being banned from the website for making too many requests too quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`re` (Regular Expression)**: This library is used to search, match, or replace patterns in strings. In our web scraping process, is particularly useful for extracting specific pieces of data from HTML or text, such as phone numbers, prices, or other structured information from rental listings.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`pandas` (pd)**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library. After scraping the data, `pandas` can be used to clean, transform, and analyze the rental listings data, making it easier to work with large datasets and perform complex data analysis tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`csv`**: This module implements classes to read and write tabular data in CSV format. It can be used to save scraped data into CSV files, which is a common format for storing tabular data, allowing for easy sharing and analysis of the scraped rental listings.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`BeautifulSoup` (from `bs4`)**: A library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates parse trees that is helpful to extract information from web pages easily. `BeautifulSoup` works well with `requests` to navigate the HTML structure of a page and extract data, such as rental prices, descriptions, and images.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`playwright.async_api` (async_playwright, TimeoutError)**: `playwright` is a framework for browser automation and `async_playwright` refers to its asynchronous API. This is particularly useful for interacting with JavaScript-heavy websites like RentFaster, allowing for headless browser interaction, page navigation, and dynamic content loading. The `TimeoutError` helps in handling exceptions that may occur if a page takes too long to load or respond.\n",

It employs the Playwright library to programmatically control a web browser, navigating to a specified URL and waiting for the page to load fully before capturing its HTML content. This is particularly useful for RentFaster that dynamicaly loads content asynchronously with JavaScript.\n",
        "\n",
        "The function is capable of making multiple attempts to fetch a page's content, retrying up to a predefined limit in case of timeouts, which can occur with Kijiji. This retry mechanism, coupled with the ability to wait for specific page elements to appear before proceeding, ensures reliability in the scraping process. It can specifically wait for elements that signify the page has fully loaded on either RentFaster or Kijiji, based on parameters passed to it. After successfully retrieving the page content, the browser session is closed to clean up resources. If the function fails to fetch the content after the specified number of retries, it raises an exception to signal the failure. This approach ensures robustness and flexibility in scraping tasks, accommodating the challenges posed these websites.\n"

        "### Scraping and Parsing content from Website\n",
        "To understand the structure and dynamics of HTML content fetched from Kijiji and RentFaster is important to effectively use web scraping, especially when extracting detailed information about rental listings. This complexity arises because websites such as RentFaster often employ dynamic content loading through JavaScript, which means the data you're interested in (e.g., address, price, listing title, description, features of the listing like pet-friendliness or laundry facilities, contact info, posting date, URL) may not be present in the initial HTML served by the web server but loaded asynchronously thereafter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given these challenges, tailored approaches are necessary for scraping each website. These functions are meticulously designed to navigate the intricacies of each site's HTML structure and JavaScript dynamics.\n",
        "\n",
        "RentFaster, for instance, stores relevant listing details within `<script>` tags in JSON format. The parsing function for RentFaster content is adept at locating these tags, extracting and decoding the JSON, and then systematically pulling out and organizing the necessary data, such as property overview, amenities, and unit details. This method hinges on the JSON being structured in a predictable manner, allowing for direct access to various pieces of information without the need to interpret the HTML visually as a browser would.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, the Kijiji content parsing function deals with a more traditional mix of HTML elements and embedded JSON scripts. It has to navigate through the document, identifying specific tags and classes to extract the listing’s description, address, and other attributes. This function also handles dynamically loaded data, requiring it to parse both the visible HTML and the JavaScript variables or window properties that contain JSON data with additional details about the listings.\n",
        "\n",
        "The need for these tailored functions arise from the variance in how each website delivers content to the end-user. While one site might embed data within HTML in a straightforward manner, another might rely heavily on JavaScript to construct the page dynamically, necessitating a flexible and nuanced approach to scraping.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project highlights a broader principle in web scraping: the importance of carefully analyzing the source content of a website to understand how it structures and delivers data. This analysis is crucial for designing efficient scrapers that can reliably extract the needed information despite the complexities of modern web development practices, including the use of JavaScript and AJAX for dynamic content loading. Such an understanding not only informs the technical strategy for data extraction but also ensures the scraper can adapt to changes in the website's structure or content delivery mechanisms over time.\n"

When dealing with web scraped data from rental listings on RentFaster and Kijiji, `pyspark` enables efficient data processing and analysis at scale. Here's how it contributes to our project:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Data Exploration**: `pyspark` allows for comprehensive data exploration, including summarizing datasets, querying specific information (e.g., average rental prices, most common amenities), and identifying trends within the rental market of Alberta, Canada.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Data Transformation**: The data scraped from these websites often requires cleaning and transformation to be useful for analysis. `pyspark` provides a wide array of functions for data manipulation, such as filtering, grouping, and aggregating data. This is essential for preparing the web scraped data, which may include varying formats, missing values, or irrelevant information, into a structured and analysis-ready format.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Seamless Integration**: By using `findspark`, you can more easily integrate Apache Spark into your Python environment for web scraping projects. It ensures that `pyspark` can be imported and used in your scripts as any other Python library, without the need for cumbersome setup processes or environment configuration. This is particularly useful in educational or experimental projects where simplifying the setup process can save valuable time and effort.\n"

        "- **`findspark.init()`**: This function call is used to initialize Spark in the Python script. It must be called before importing and using `pyspark`, as it sets up the environment by locating the Spark installation and setting the necessary environment variables. This step ensures that `pyspark` can be imported without issues related to finding the Spark installation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`pyspark`**: The Python API for Apache Spark, `pyspark` allows Python programmers to interface with Spark's distributed data processing capabilities. By importing `pyspark`, you gain access to Spark's core functionalities, including creating RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets), transformations, and actions on these datasets, enabling large-scale data processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`from pyspark.sql import SparkSession`**: SparkSession is the entry point to programming Spark with the Dataset and DataFrame API. A SparkSession can be used to create DataFrame objects, register DataFrame as tables, execute SQL queries, and read data from an external source. Importing SparkSession is essential for working with Spark SQL and DataFrame operations, which are powerful tools for data analysis, especially when dealing with structured data like that obtained from web scraping."

After setting up your account, head to the Yelp Fusion API section on the Yelp Developer page and select 'Get Started.' This action will grant you access to API keys that are essential for fetching restaurant data, allowing you to perform queries based on addresses extracted from your rental listings. By integrating Yelp Fusion data with our scraped rental information, we can provide a comprehensive view of each listing's neighborhood amenities, enhancing the value of our dataset with actionable insights for potential renters.\n"
